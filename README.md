# Multitable
## Description
I decided to start this project since I was in the need of implementing a form table which contains kits of products. The end user is to add kits and each kit has any quantity of products, this library also includes validation to ensure that the user's input matches a given RegExp, otherwise it tells the user their input is not valid for a given input.
<p>I am willing to keep this the most generic because I want to use this library for any kind of form table I would need to implement in the future. I defined three types of tables for now:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Table (Normal)</li>
    <li>GroupTable (A table of sets)</li>
    <li>Multitable (It contains two types of tables)</li>
</ul>
